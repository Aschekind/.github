# Aschekind

Welcome to **Aschekind**, the home of personal and experimental software projects by a solo developer passionate about low-level systems, game technology, and creative engineering.

## 🧠 Vision

Aschekind exists to explore the intersection of **performance-oriented programming**, **real-time graphics**, and **creative tools** — with a strong focus on long-term learning and autonomy.

The ultimate goal is to build and own tools that empower game creation, from the ground up.

## 🔧 Active Project

### [Graphyne](https://github.com/Aschekind/Graphyne)

A lightweight 3D game engine built with C++, Vulkan, and SDL.  
Graphyne is a personal R&D initiative aiming to explore custom engine architecture, multithreading, and modern graphics pipelines.

## 🧍 Who’s behind this?

All projects under this organization are currently developed and maintained by a single person ([@Multyp](https://github.com/Multyp)).  
There are no open calls for contributions at this stage, but **feedback, curiosity, and collaboration ideas are always welcome**.
